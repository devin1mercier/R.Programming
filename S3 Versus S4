# My S3 example
  # Creating an object:
    me.S3 <- list(name = "Devin", age = 25, weight = 180)
  # Specifying the object's class:
    class(me.S3) <- "person"
  # Testing the object with different functions:
    mode(me.S3)
    class(me.S3)
    attributes(me.S3)

# My S4 example:
  # Defining the "person" class:
    setClass("person", representation(name = "character", age = "numeric", weight = "numeric")
  # Creating an object:
    me.S4 <- new("person", name = "Devin", age = 25, weight = 180)
    me.S4
  # Testing the object with mode():
    mode(me.S4)
  # Checking the type of one of the object's variables:
    mode(slot(me.S4, "age"))
  # Testing that the reference member variable "@" works with the object:
    me.S4@name
  # Checking that the object is a part of the S4 system:
    isS4(me.S4)

install.packages("pryr")
library(pryr)
# Checking the systems of my objects:
  otype(me.S3)
  otype(me.S4)
